# Mumbo Gumbo


## Overview:

MumboGumbo is a game that randomly assigns each of the four fixins: shrimp, rice, sausage, and okra a value between 1 and 12. It also randomly assigns the gumbo a needed flavor value between 19 and 120. The player needs to add up the proper number of fixins to meet the needed flavor. If they get it exactly right, they win, if they go over, they lose.


## Components Used:

* html
* css
* bootstrap
* javascript
* jquery


## Takeaway:

It was much easier for me to conceptualize what would be needed to make the game work having worked with Javascript and Jquery before. With a better understanding of what was needed to go into the game, I was able to do a more comprehensive pseudo-code which grately reduced the time and frustration of the project as compared to previous projects. 

Many of the issues I did end up having were issues of scope. I got the game working as it should, but most of the jquery was put into the individual click functions for each fixin button. I would like to have a function to update the win/loss/flavor level increase values that was called when each fixin was clicked.
